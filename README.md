## 👋 About Me:
My name is Guillaume, born on October 12, 1992. After spending six years in the automotive industry , I decided to pursue a career change into the tech field, specifically as a web and mobile developer, as I felt the automotive industry no longer aligned with my aspirations. With a long-standing passion for video games 🎮 and a strong interest in hardware 💻, I became increasingly intrigued by the technology that powers these fields. This curiosity led me to develop a keen interest in web development . Although I am still at the beginning of my journey, I am highly motivated and eager 🚀 to share my GitHub, which represents this new chapter in my professional life .
